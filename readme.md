## Start Working on the Project

docker start mysql

docker start web

docker attach web

OR

docker-compose up

*run the `docker-compose up` command in the normal terminal window in the same directory as docker-compose.yml You do not need to start web but make sure mysql is running.*


## During Demo

The documentation says we should create a new model for users - what if we created our models based on user-types: students and CIOs.

Would we need to determine if the logging in user is a student or CIO in the EXP layer?

What does "service-based authentication in your experience services" mean?
